# OpenGLRayTrace

A repository containing my journey learning OpenGL compute shaders and following Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series by Peter Shirley.
My goal is a ray tracing program where the user can add, move and change material and colours of spheres(and eventually objects made of triangles), and other settings on the fly, seeing real-time results.

In this project I use GLFW, GLEW, stb and ImGui, which can be found in the "Dependencies" folder, including the respective licenses.
